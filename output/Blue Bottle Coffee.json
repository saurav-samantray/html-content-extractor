        "paragraphdump": ". Not to be confused with The Blue Bottle Coffee House. Blue Bottle Coffee, Inc. is a coffee roaster and retailer headquartered in Oakland, California, United States. In 2017, a majority stake in the company was acquired by Nestl. It is considered a major player in third wave coffee.[1] The company focuses on single-origin beans.[2]. The company while based in Oakland, California soon expanded to other areas around the country. Blue Bottle first expanded to several cafs in locations around San Francisco, including the Ferry Building and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art's rooftop garden.[3] The company operated 29 stores in 2016, and it anticipates having more than 50 cafes open by end of 2017 in California, New York, Washington, D.C., Miami, Seoul and Tokyo.[4]. W. James Freeman founded Blue Bottle Coffee in the early 2000s in Oakland, CA, borrowing the name from one of Europe's first cafes, The Blue Bottle Coffee House. His intention was to roast coffee in small batches (6 lbs. per roast) to sell within 24 hours of roasting, initially as a home-delivery service. Blue Bottle soon ceased deliveries and opened as a traditional cafe.[5]. Blue Bottle opened additional locations in San Francisco and elsewhere in the San Francisco Bay Area, and then opened its first New York location in Williamsburg, Brooklyn in 2010.[6] The company-owned stores carry off-menu items such as the \"Gibraltar\", a form of cortado.[3]. In 2012, Blue Bottle received $20 million in venture capital investment.[7]. In January 2014, Blue Bottle raised $25.75 million in new round of funding.[8]. In 2015, Blue Bottle completed a venture capital round in which it raised $70 million+ from investors led by Fidelity.[9]. Since its inception, the company has raised $120 million from investors.[10]. In September 2017, Nestle S.A., the world's largest food and drinks company, acquired a majority stake of Blue Bottle.[11] While the deal's financial details were not disclosed, the Financial Times reported \"Nestle is understood to be paying up to $500m for the 68 per cent stake in Blue Bottle\".[12] Blue Bottle expected to increase sales by 70% in 2017.[13] . In September 2018, Blue Bottle Coffee opened its first location in Kobe, Japan.[14] In May 2019, Blue Bottle Coffee opened its first location in Seoul, South Korea.[15]. ",
