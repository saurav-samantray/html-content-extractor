The roastery's latest San Francisco outpost on Sutter Street offers a full array of classic coffee drinks made with Blue Bottle Coffee's own roasts and blends. Stop in to this contemporary cafe for single-origin pour-overs, bags of beans and one of Blue Bottle's signatureLige waffles.. With a 3.5-star rating out of three reviews on Yelp so far, the new locale is finding its way, but it's still early days.. L B., who was among the first Yelpers to review the new spot on Oct. 26, wrote, \"Very nice Blue Bottle with lots of seating. Fast service, friendly staff, great location.\".
