        "paragraphdump": "Trunk Club is a personalized mid- to high-end men's and women's clothing service based in Chicago, Illinois, United States. Each customer works with a specialist who chooses clothing for their box, which is shipped to their home; the customer can then either purchase the clothes or send them back to Trunk Club. The service can be completed virtually or in person at one of the company's six locations.. Trunk Club was founded in 2009 by Joanna Van Vleck while she was an MBA student. It began as a personalized clothing service based in Bend, Oregon.[1][2][3][4]. Trunk Club first received $11 million of Series A funding led by US Venture Partners. Brian Spaly was asked to be CEO of Trunk Club by Anthos Capital. He left Bonobos in order to do so.[2]. Spaly relocated the company to downtown Chicago and opened Trunk Club HQ, a physical space where customers can have one-on-one styling appointments.[2] In-person locations called clubhouses have since expanded to Dallas, Washington DC, New York City, Los Angeles, and Boston.[5]. Trunk Club was acquired by Nordstrom in 2014 for an estimated $350M.[6][7] In an interview with the New York Times at the time of the acquisition, Spaly said that the company was profitable, \"though barely\" at the time.[8] After the company's value went down by more than half in November 2016, Spaly announced his departure from the company in early 2017. Terry Boyle, who leads Nordstrom brands Nordstrom Rack and HauteLook, took over the position.[9]. Trunk Club currently operates as a wholesaler and sells products at retail cost, rather than via a subscription model. There is a $25 home styling fee for each trunk that may be applied towards purchases. It is free for customers to receive consultations with a stylist in person at a clubhouse. Customers pay for the items they wish to keep, which usually range in price from $100 to $300 per item.[10]. Trunk Club also has run \"designer series\" trunks which are collaborations with some of their best-selling brands.[11]. In 2015, Trunk Club launched their styling services for women.[5][12]. There has been some feedback around the \"immediately apparent\" use of attractive young women as staff at the on-site locations, which some have seen as off-putting, as well as the aura of throwback masculinity epitomized in the clubhouses.[4][13]",
