        "paragraphdump": "Everlane is an American clothing retailer that sells primarily online. The organization is headquartered in San Francisco, California and also has a store in New York City.  The company was founded with the mission of selling clothing   with transparent pricing.    . Everlane was founded in 2010 by Michael Preysman and Jesse Farmer as an online menswear retailer.  By 2015, the company had received $1.1 million in seed funding.  Everlane started with a referral invite list that gained 60,000 subscribers in 5 days, although the company only had 1,500 T-shirts in inventory.  In 2012, Everlane opened a pop-up shop in New York for two weeks during the holidays. . In 2014, Everlane began a partnership with delivery company Postmates to provide same-day delivery to consumers in San Francisco and New York.  In 2015, Everlane launched a mobile app, which featured weather updates and suggestions on what to wear for that particular weather. . The company opened permanent stores in SoHo in New York City in 2017 and in San Francisco in 2018.    Everlane has factories in China, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Italy, Spain, Peru and the United States. . Everlane uses its website and social media to educate customers on its supply chain, factories, employees, and the price breakdown of each product.  . The brand expanded into denim in 2017, after Preysman delayed the launch until the company could find a factory that met the business' sustainability standards. Head of product, Kim Smith, eventually found one in Vietnam, that recycles 98% of the water used in denim manufacturing and turns any chemicals used in the process into bricks for constructing affordable houses.  . In 2018, the company pledged to stop using virgin plastic by 2021, including in packaging and in clothing made of synthetic fibers.   On October 24, 2018, Everlane launched ReNew, a line of outerwear crafted from materials that were created out of 3 million recycled plastic bottles.  The company plans to accomplish their goal by redeveloping the fabrics, yarns, and all raw materials that contain synthetic fibres into recycled components by 2021.  In May 2019, Everlane released the DayGlove ReKnit, a shoe made entirely of recycled plastic bottles. . Everlane holds \"Choose What You Pay\" sales, which allow shoppers to select one of three prices for a piece of merchandise. The lowest price covers production and shipping cost, while the higher prices cover additional costs such as overhead. The website is transparent about what the cost of the item would cover.  Preysman, CEO of Everlane, explained the sale as an attempt to make the brand more transparent. . The brand has received publicity via actress Angelina Jolie, who has been seen wearing Everlane loafers  and carrying an Everlane tote bag.  Model Gigi Hadid has worn Everlane sneakers.  The Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle, has been photographed wearing an Everlane cashmere sweater. . In 2015, founder Michael Preysman was included in Forbes' 30 Under 30 for his work on the firm in \"reinventing retail and E-Commerce.\"  Preysman has also been included in the BoF 500, an index of the people shaping the contemporary fashion industry.
